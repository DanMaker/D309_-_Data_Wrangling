    "This is the twitter archive dataset Udacity got from WeRateDogs. When Udacity received this, it contained basic tweet data for some 5000+ tweets. It is missing some fields that are in each tweet, this is provided to the student as an exercise in using an API. One field included in this archive is the text of each tweet. From this Udacity has extracted the name of the dog, and rating, in the form of a numerator and denominator and the standardized silly doggie descriptors used by WeRateDogs, referred to as \"stage.\" These are doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo. This modified archive is provided to the student as a 'Twitter archive \"enhanced.\"' Tweets with out photos or ratings were removed leaving only 2356 in the archive."
