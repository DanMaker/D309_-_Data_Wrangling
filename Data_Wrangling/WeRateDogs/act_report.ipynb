    "## Background\n",
    "[WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) is a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/home) account that takes an unconventional approach to rating photos, and videos of dogs. He uses a normal fraction system, but the numerator is almost always greater than the denominator. He also uses [nonce words](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Glossary#nonce_word) such as \"doggo\" and \"pupper\" to describe them. His has leveraged his fame to raise funds to help dogs in need through his [15/10 Foundation](https://twitter.com/15outof10). His web site is https://links.weratedogs.com/\n",

    "Of 2356 tweets 1390 give the name of the dog, and there are 929 different names. The \"most common\" names are Charlie and Lucy with 11 uses each, followed by Oliver, Cooper, Penny and Tucker with 10, 10, 9 and 9 uses respectively.\n",

    "The insight here is that there is a very large diversity in dog names, with no clear favorite names."

    "From those same 2356 original tweets 1666 have had the breed of the dog identified (this was done using machine learning by a course at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). These 1666 identified dogs represent 113 breeds, and there are some clear leaders for breed popularity, at least in photos posted to this twitter feed. I have prepared two pie charts with this data:"
